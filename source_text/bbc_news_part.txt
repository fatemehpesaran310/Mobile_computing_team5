The British public is refusing to let typical bank holiday weather spoil its Coronation plans and is gearing up for street parties and family celebrations.

Around £200m will be spent on food and drink this weekend, according to the Centre for Retail Research (CRR).

Supermarket chain Lidl said it had sold enough bunting to line the Coronation procession route 75 times over.

Party products and traditional British fayre are in high demand and brands are offering royal-themed ranges.
Overall the CRR expects consumers to add more than £1.4bn to the UK economy over the long weekend.

Tesco said it was on track to sell 675,000 pork pies and 300,000 pots of clotted cream.

Sales of quiches, the King's chosen Coronation dish, have leapt across the country - Aldi said it was selling more than 30 every minute and Waitrose said it had seen an increase of 25% in the last week.

Scones too are flying off the shelves - at Aldi they are up a massive 150%, Tesco expected to sell 600,000.

Dozens of products from pork pies and golden syrup to gin and elderflower cordial have gone purple and gold or tweaked their branding to feature Buckingham Palace, crowns and bunting. Ikea is offering a coronation chicken flavour sauce on its famous meatballs.

Tesco's Maheen Piracha said shoppers were in a mood to celebrate: "Judging by early sales, King Charles' Coronation is set to spark a feel-good factor with plenty of street and house parties."
